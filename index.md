Adriaan Moors
=============
I used to be a post-doc working on the [Scala programming language](http://scala-lang.org) in [Martin Odersky's lab](http://lamp.epfl.ch). My [EPFL homepage](http://people.epfl.ch/adriaan.moors) has my work contact info. Google will tell you all about [personal-me](http://www.google.com/profiles/adriaanm).

I'm now the Scala Tech lead at [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com), and waaaaay to busy to update this page.

Everything below this sentence is from my former life.

Research
========
I'm interested in exploiting static types to make programming more productive.

Concretely, my colleagues and I are working on (in decreasing order of personal involvement):
1. Improving Scala's type inference and implicit search algorithms
1. Virtualizing Scala to optimize embedded Domain Specific Languages
1. A practical effect system for Scala
1. Type debugging for Scala

I spend a fair amount of time hacking scalac, particularly fixing bugs in the type checker. If you have a ticket that's assigned to me (I'm "moors" in [trac](http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/)), but which isn't in trunk yet, maybe it's already fixed in [my fork](http://github.com/adriaanm/scala) of the official Scala repository. The branch you're looking for is ticket/NNNN.

I hope to find time to write down some of the stuff I'm working on (or have worked on). In the meantime, please check [DBLP](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Moors:Adriaan.html), ask [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:adriaan+moors), or have a look at [our lab's publication page](http://lamp.epfl.ch/publications/index.html.en).
