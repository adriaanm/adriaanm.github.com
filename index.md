Adriaan Moors
=============
I'm the Scala Tech lead at [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com).
Happily hacking the Scala compiler and thinking of where to take Scala.

I [tweet](https://twitter.com/adriaanm) about Scala,
I give [talks](https://github.com/adriaanm/talks) once in a while, and 
I once wrote something about [type constructor inference](http://adriaanm.github.io/research/2010/10/06/new-in-scala-2.8-type-constructor-inference/).

Once upon a time, I used to be a post-doc working on the [Scala programming language](http://scala-lang.org) in [Martin Odersky's lab](http://lamp.epfl.ch), where I implemented (before my post-doc) support for type constructor polymorphism and type constructor inference. During my post-doc, I worked on the formal semantics for Scala, integrated implicit search more tightly with type inference and dependent method types, and as my final act, rewrote the pattern-matcher for Scala 2.10.
