Adriaan Moors
=============
I'm now the Scala Tech lead at [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com).
Happily hacking the Scala compiler and thinking of where to take Scala.

I give [talks](https://github.com/adriaanm/talks) once in a while,
and hack on the [PR validator](https://github.com/adriaanm/ghpullrequest-validator) from time to time.

I used to be a post-doc working on the [Scala programming language](http://scala-lang.org) in [Martin Odersky's lab](http://lamp.epfl.ch). My [EPFL homepage](http://people.epfl.ch/adriaan.moors) has my work contact info. Google will tell you all about [personal-me](http://www.google.com/profiles/adriaanm).

I once wrote something about [type constructor inference](http://adriaanm.github.io/research/2010/10/06/new-in-scala-2.8-type-constructor-inference/).
